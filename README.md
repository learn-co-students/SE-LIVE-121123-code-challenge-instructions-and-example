# Module Assessments and Instructions

## Introduction

Towards the end of each phase of this course, you'll receive an assessment in
the form of a code challenge. This code challenge is a chance for you to show
off how much you've learned, see where you are in terms of grasping the
material, and get feedback from us on ways to improve or areas to work on
further.

The first challenge will cover your knowledge of JavaScript and frontend
development. Topics will include DOM manipulation, event handling, and
communicating with a server.

For the first code challenge, you'll receive a repo with instructions and
deliverables. For example, one deliverable might be "As a user, I should be able
to add a comment to a blog post". It's an open-book, totally Googleable
challenge. As opposed to standard labs, there will not be tests. Instead, we
will be reading, running, and grading your code based on how you fulfill the
requirements and your use of coding best practices. We will give you
constructive feedback based on your submission.

You can expect feedback after we grade your submission. We'll set aside time for
each of you over the subsequent week to review if you don't pass the challenge.

Future code challenge assessments will follow a similar format, but of course,
the topics will be different. You can expect any of the topics we cover in class
to be touched on in some way. The best way to prepare will be to consistently
complete labs, review your lecture notes, and build your own projects.

Please don't think of passing the assessments as the goal of your learning â€”
doing well on them should be a side effect, a by-product of you learning how to
be an amazing developer. By all means, get more practice in any areas where you
know you need it, but don't cram for a code challenge, and definitely don't
sacrifice keeping up with the labs to prepare for it.

Below, we've provided instructions for how to work on and submit your future
code challenges. This lesson is structured the same way they will be, so feel
free to practice here.

## Instructions for Working on and Submitting Code Challenge

When a code challenge is published, it will be available in the Code Challenges
module of this course.

Once it's available, you must start the code challenge by following the steps
below:

- Find and open the code challenge assignment in Canvas and download the linked
  ZIP file
- Unzip the file on your computer
  - For WSL users only, make sure to move the folder to your Linux file system after unzipping by following these steps:
  - Open Ubuntu
  - Type explorer.exe . (type that exactly - including the period after explorer.exe) to open the current WSL directory in the file explorer
  - Copy the code challenge directory into the WSL directory in the file explorer
  - If you have trouble with any of these steps, watch the WSL Troubleshooting video below.
- In your terminal, change directory (`cd`) into the unzipped challenge
  directory
- Run `ls`; you should see a `bin/` directory and a `code-challenge.bundle`
  file)
- Run `./bin/start.py <your-name>` from the directory; this will create a new
  directory called `code-challenge/`
    - If you receive permission errors during this step, run `chmod +x ./bin/start.py` to give the file executable permissions, then try again.
- `cd` into the new `code-challenge/` directory and open it in your code editor

To work on your code challenge:

- Ensure that you're in the `code-challenge/` directory
- Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file
- `git add .` and `git commit` inside of the `code-challenge/` directory often
  as you're working

To submit the code challenge:

- Navigate to the **parent directory** of `code-challenge/` in your terminal
- Run `./bin/end.py`, which will create a new file, `<your-name>.bundle` in that
  directory (for example, `alicia.bundle`)
    - If you receive permission errors during this step, run `chmod +x ./bin/end.py` to give the file executable permissions, then try again.
- Navigate back to the code challenge assignment in Canvas
- Upload `<your-name>.bundle` to the assignment and submit

**Reach out to your instructors immediately** if you run into issues
downloading, working on, or uploading your code challenge.

Here's a video walkthrough of the above steps. Note the beginning will look a little different for you, but the rest of the steps will be the same:

### WSL Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble working on your code challenge in WSL2, make sure to follow the steps in this (slightly old) vidoe to ensure your code is running in the WSL2 file system.
