## Mock-code challenge README

Congratualtions!  If you're seeing this, it means you successfully ran the `bin/start` Python script. You should now also see some placeholder files, such as an `index.html` file, `src/index.js` and this `README.md` file.

If this were an actual code challenge, you would now be able to start working on the challenge. You would make `git` commits as you normally would.  At the end of the challenge, you will run the `bin/end` script.  See the instructions in the enclosing README.md and try it now.
